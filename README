Here is the newly created thorn for FLRW.  
Directions:
	* Put the entire thorn (i.e., the folder FLRWSolver) in the directory Cactus/arrangements/EinsteinInitialData/
          You can do this directly from the git repository on bitbucket using:
          
          cd Cactus/arrangements/EinsteinInitialData/
          git clone https://USERNAME@bitbucket.org/danielprice/flrwsolver.git
          
          replacing USERNAME with your bitbucket username.

	* add a line in the thornlist file that says (for me this is the file Cactus/manifest/einsteintoolkit.th):
	      EinsteinInitialData/flrwSolver

	* Recompile and enjoy
