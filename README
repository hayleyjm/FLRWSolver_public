Here is the newly created thorn for FLRW.  
Directions:
	* Put the entire thorn (i.e., the folder FLRWSolver) in the directory Cactus/arrangements/EinsteinInitialData/

	* add a line in the thornlist file that says (for me this is the file Cactus/manifest/einsteintoolkit.th):
	      EinsteinInitialData/FLRWSolver

	* Recompile and enjoy
