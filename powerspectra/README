Here are some sample power spectrum files that are compatible with FLRWSolver.

camb/
These files were generated by running CAMB (Lewis & Bridle, 2002, arXiv:astro-ph/0205436) at redshifts of z=1100,1000, and z=200 as indicated in the name of each file.
The files were created in early 2017.

class/
These powerspectra were generated by running CLASS as chosen redshift in a chosen gauge. We have longitudinal and synchronous gauge, note FLRWSolver should be given P(k) in synchronous gauge, and will translate this to longitudinal ICs.

All powerspectra were generated with specific cosmology values (h=0.7 and otherwise default parameters). If you do not use EdS model parameters to run CAMB/CLASS you may arrive at inconsistent results. Be wary.
We recommend you run CAMB/CLASS yourself using your preferred cosmological parameters BEFORE running FLRWSolver.
