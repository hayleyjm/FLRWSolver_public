Here is a sample matter power spectrum file which can be read with FLRWSolver.

The powerspectrum was generated by running CLASS at redshift z=1000 in synchronous gauge, with h=0.7 and otherwise default cosmological parameters.

We recommend you run CAMB/CLASS yourself using your preferred cosmological parameters BEFORE running FLRWSolver.
