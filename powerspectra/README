Here are some sample power spectra which can be read with FLRWSolver.

1. EdS_matterpower_synchronous_z1000.dat

   This is the matter powerspectrum output from CLASS at redshift z=1000 in synchronous gauge. We used h=0.45 and otherwise default cosmological parameters (Planck 2018).

2. EdS_phipower_newtonian_z20.dat

   This is the \phi powerspectrum output from CAMB at redshift z=20 in newtonian gauge. We used parameters as above. Phi used in CAMB and defined in FLRWSolver are the same. 



While these examples are useful to make sure your code set-up is working correctly, we strongly recommend you run CAMB/CLASS yourself using your preferred cosmological parameters BEFORE running FLRWSolver.
