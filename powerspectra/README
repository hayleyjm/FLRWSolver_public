Here are some sample power spectrum files that are compatible with FLRWSolver.

By default, the code will read these files for power spectrum initial conditions.

These files were generated by running CAMB (Lewis & Bridle, 2002, arXiv:astro-ph/0205436) at redshifts of z=1100 and z=200 as indicated in the name.
The files were created in early 2017.

We recommend you run CAMB yourself using your preffered cosmological parameters BEFORE running FLRWSolver.
