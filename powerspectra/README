Here are some sample power spectrum files that are compatible with FLRWSolver.

camb/
These files were generated by running CAMB (Lewis & Bridle, 2002, arXiv:astro-ph/0205436) at redshifts of z=1100 and z=200 as indicated in the name.
The files were created in early 2017.

class/
These powerspectra were generated by running CLASS as chosen redshift in a chosen gauge. 

We recommend you run CAMB/CLASS yourself using your preffered cosmological parameters BEFORE running FLRWSolver.
