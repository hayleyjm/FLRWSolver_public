here are some extra codes we might want to use with FLRWSolver
- framedrag test (FINISHED PAPER)
- synch, comving ICs (didn't quite work, and doesn't seem to be going any further...)

and the corresponding param.ccl and schedule.ccl that works with both of these files present in src/

- H. Mac (I removed these for the public version)
